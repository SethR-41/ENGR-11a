                            <p>This project was fairly simple! I started by downloading the proper 3MF file for the name tag and opening it in Prusa Slicer, which I already had downloaded from my Ancient Technology and Modern Technology class with Professor Ratzlaff last semester. After that, I was able to edit the font and change the name tag so that it actually has my name on it. My print ended up using 4.03 grams of filament and taking a little over 20 minutes, and I printed it with a brown base and switched it to a yellow filament during the filament swap.</p>

                            <p>As for the actual printing process itself, there was really only a minor hiccup in that the printer was unresponsive at first, but by simply power cycling the machine, I was able to get it up and running properly again in no time. The filament swap was also relatively easy, and I didn’t run into any issues regarding improper feeding or anything. I am really pleased with how it came out!</p>

                            <p>To start this part of the project, I looked around on Thingiverse and Printables to find something that seemed like a difficult print (based off of my rather rudimentary knowledge of 3D printing). After looking through several different models, I ended up finding one that seemed nearly impossible. It had large, unsupported overhangs and included several upside down cones with tiny points of contact to the build plate. In fact, I was even recommended to add a two-layer raft so that there was even a slim chance of it printing somewhat correctly. (Which I did add, not that it ended up helping that much.) After downloading the STL and uploading it to Prusa Slicer, I had to scale it down so it would fit on the build plate. I found making that sort of small edit with Prusa to be pretty simple! I can definitely see myself finding some cool models to print in the future (I’m already planning on printing a deck box for Magic the Gathering soon) and those sorts of simple, in-slicer edits will most definitely be helpful.</p>

                            <p>When it comes to the physical print, things most certainly went wrong. Just in watching the first few layers, I could immediately see that the sections based off of small points of contact on the plate were already not sticking well to the rafts. I was honestly surprised when I saw well the bridging sections came out, all things considered. Granted, there was still not amazing bridging, as the underside of those sections were a little bit rough and stringy. Other than that, I mostly ended up with a mess of filament spaghetti, which I think is due to the printer trying to print on top of air because the layers that those sections were supposed to print over did not adhere to the bed. Apparently, the print even had to be stopped part way through because it was beginning to form a gloopy slug. Overall, this project was very helpful for me to get an idea of the limits and capabilities of this kind of 3D printing, and I think I will have a better understanding of what these machines are capable of, not to mention that I should definitely use supports when the slicer advises me to!</p>

                            <p>This part of project 2 went really smooth! I decided to print an owlbear miniature for a D&D encounter I plan on running soon. I used Thangs to find the STLs that I wanted to use, which consisted of an owlbear and the rock that it is standing on (separate files but made by the same modeler), a cave-terrain base for the mini, a nest, and an egg model that I copied three times. (The screenshots I’ve included have the eggs and nest hidden by the legs, sorry!)</p>

                            <p>At a certain point in the process, I would honestly say that this project perfectly bridged the gap between a project for class and a passion project! I used meshlab to simplify the mesh of the owlbear, but otherwise I was able to import all the other models into tinkercad without any issues. Using tinkercad was really easy. I’ve used the program several times before, so it was just a matter of positioning everything how I wanted it, grouping the objects together, and exporting the file as a 3MF.</p>

                            <p>This print came out *really* well! I am honestly a little shocked with just how much detail was conferred, despite the mesh for the owlbear having been simplified. I think the only tiny nitpicks I have with the finished result is that the foot of the owlbear is technically not quite touching the rock that it's supposed to be posed on, but it really isn't noticeable and still is extremely stable. Additionally, the base was a little too thick in my opinion, so if I were to remodel it I would probably try to cut off part of the bottom to thin it out. Also, the owlbear itself was roughly half an inch taller than I expected, so I would probably also scale it down slightly in the future, but overall those are nonissues in the long run. The only other thing that I noticed was that there was a teeny tiny little bit of stringing near the nest area, so I lightly used the heat gun to clean that up.</p>

                            <p>I can't even count how many attempts, errors, and crashes I got when trying to do this part. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that Fusion simply hates the idea of trying to split and reconstruct so many polygons, and thus refuses to do it. Having given up on the grid, I just made sure to add tolerance for the pit section to slide in and out.</p>

                            <p> I then exported it to Prusa, where I realized it was too big for the build plate, resized it and the hole back in Fusion (I needed the pit section to remain 2 inches by 2 inches), and finally got it sliced properly and got it printed!</p>

                            <p>This part of the project led to a lot of really good learning for me! While my many hours of continuous failure were certainly frustrating, I think it was very helpful in the long run. I certainly can say that I feel much more confident with using Fusion, and I can really see just how much more powerful of a tool it is than tinkercad.</p>

                            <p> This part of the project came out really well though! I’m a huge fan of the filament I ended up using; I think the blends of yellows and greens are really cool looking. I’m also really happy with the buttery smooth tolerance between the two parts, and I think that the cragginess of the tallest side is perfect. If I had to do this project again, I would definitely make sure to sketch out the build plate first so that I can make sure to be working within the bounds of the print bed the whole time, and I would probably try to use a less complex mesh so that I can actually do my uniform-depth-engraved grid idea, especially because I definitely didn't actually need as much detail as I used. Additionally, I would maybe try a slightly tighter tolerance to see if I can’t make the cut away section blend in a little better. Overall though, I would say that this part of the project was pretty much a complete success (aside from my inability to add a grid like I had originally planned.</p>
