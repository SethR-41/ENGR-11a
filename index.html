                            <p>This project was fairly simple! I started by downloading the proper 3MF file for the name tag and opening it in Prusa Slicer, which I already had downloaded from my Ancient Technology and Modern Technology class with Professor Ratzlaff last semester. After that, I was able to edit the font and change the name tag so that it actually has my name on it. My print ended up using 4.03 grams of filament and taking a little over 20 minutes, and I printed it with a brown base and switched it to a yellow filament during the filament swap.</p>

                            <p>As for the actual printing process itself, there was really only a minor hiccup in that the printer was unresponsive at first, but by simply power cycling the machine, I was able to get it up and running properly again in no time. The filament swap was also relatively easy, and I didn’t run into any issues regarding improper feeding or anything. I am really pleased with how it came out!</p>

                            <p>To start this part of the project, I looked around on Thingiverse and Printables to find something that seemed like a difficult print (based off of my rather rudimentary knowledge of 3D printing). After looking through several different models, I ended up finding one that seemed nearly impossible. It had large, unsupported overhangs and included several upside down cones with tiny points of contact to the build plate. In fact, I was even recommended to add a two-layer raft so that there was even a slim chance of it printing somewhat correctly. (Which I did add, not that it ended up helping that much.) After downloading the STL and uploading it to Prusa Slicer, I had to scale it down so it would fit on the build plate. I found making that sort of small edit with Prusa to be pretty simple! I can definitely see myself finding some cool models to print in the future (I’m already planning on printing a deck box for Magic the Gathering soon) and those sorts of simple, in-slicer edits will most definitely be helpful.</p>

                            <p>When it comes to the physical print, things most certainly went wrong. Just in watching the first few layers, I could immediately see that the sections based off of small points of contact on the plate were already not sticking well to the rafts. I was honestly surprised when I saw well the bridging sections came out, all things considered. Granted, there was still not amazing bridging, as the underside of those sections were a little bit rough and stringy. Other than that, I mostly ended up with a mess of filament spaghetti, which I think is due to the printer trying to print on top of air because the layers that those sections were supposed to print over did not adhere to the bed. Apparently, the print even had to be stopped part way through because it was beginning to form a gloopy slug. Overall, this project was very helpful for me to get an idea of the limits and capabilities of this kind of 3D printing, and I think I will have a better understanding of what these machines are capable of, not to mention that I should definitely use supports when the slicer advises me to!</p>

I used Thangs to find the STLs that I wanted to use, which consisted of an owlbear and the rock that it is standing on (separate files but made by the same modeler), a cave-terrain base for the mini, a nest, and an egg model that I copied three times. (The screenshots I’ve included have the eggs and nest hidden by the legs, sorry!)</p>

                            <p>At a certain point in the process, I would honestly say that this project perfectly bridged the gap between a project for class and a passion project! I used meshlab to simplify the mesh of the owlbear, but otherwise I was able to import all the other models into tinkercad without any issues. Using tinkercad was really easy. I’ve used the program several times before, so it was just a matter of positioning everything how I wanted it, grouping the objects together, and exporting the file as a 3MF.</p>

                            <p>This print came out *really* well! I am honestly a little shocked with just how much detail was conferred, despite the mesh for the owlbear having been simplified. I think the only tiny nitpicks I have with the finished result is that the foot of the owlbear is technically not quite touching the rock that it's supposed to be posed on, but it really isn't noticeable and still is extremely stable. Additionally, the base was a little too thick in my opinion, so if I were to remodel it I would probably try to cut off part of the bottom to thin it out. Also, the owlbear itself was roughly half an inch taller than I expected, so I would probably also scale it down slightly in the future, but overall those are nonissues in the long run. The only other thing that I noticed was that there was a teeny tiny little bit of stringing near the nest area, so I lightly used the heat gun to clean that up.</p>

Eventually, I came to the conclusion that Fusion simply hates the idea of trying to split and reconstruct so many polygons, and thus refuses to do it. Having given up on the grid, I just made sure to add tolerance for the pit section to slide in and out.</p>

                            <p> This part of the project came out really well though! I’m a huge fan of the filament I ended up using; I think the blends of yellows and greens are really cool looking. I’m also really happy with the buttery smooth tolerance between the two parts, and I think that the cragginess of the tallest side is perfect. If I had to do this project again, I would definitely make sure to sketch out the build plate first so that I can make sure to be working within the bounds of the print bed the whole time, and I would probably try to use a less complex mesh so that I can actually do my uniform-depth-engraved grid idea, especially because I definitely didn't actually need as much detail as I used. Additionally, I would maybe try a slightly tighter tolerance to see if I can’t make the cut away section blend in a little better. Overall though, I would say that this part of the project was pretty much a complete success (aside from my inability to add a grid like I had originally planned.</p>

                            <p>The instructions seem pretty straightforward! I would expect the challenges to be the actual process of soldering. While I have soldered before, I have had issues with burning/stripping the board, soldering poor connections, etc. in the past. Something that seems a little unclear from the instructions how the yellow gaskets and wheel pieces attach. I think it would be nice if the instructions used more descriptive language about how to actually install the pieces. For example, if it said “press-fit the…” or “screw on the…” However, I do really appreciate how the directions instruct us to enjoy the effect at the end.</p>

For our second car, “Bathilda” (right) Jake soldered most of the components on while I troubleshooted Bafilda. After checking every component twice, the issue turned out to be poor batteries, which was frustrating to say the least. The dimensions of boards of the cars were as follows: Thickness - 1.44mm, Inner width - 57.69mm, Outer front width - 72.42mm, Outer back width - 69.52mm, Back indent to front - 100.27mm, and Back indent depth - 4.1mm.

Unfortunately, however, after a small drop during a test of Bafilda, one of the LEDs detached slightly from the board, stripping off part of one of the traces, so we had to move forward with only Bathilda. We ended up coming up with the idea of a horse mounted to Bathilda via slots on the side of the legs.</p>

I had forgotten that the circuit board had things attached to it, and thus Hort would not be able to be slid on like I had thought. We ended up cutting two of the legs off with a bandsaw in order to mount Hort onto Bathilda, which was not ideal because it was quite finicky to wedge in the legs in a way that remained stable, especially seeing how the legs on that side of Hort’s body were slightly shorter due to the material removed by the bandsaw. Additionally, because of the weight, Bathilda struggled a little bit due to the added resistance.</p>

                            <p> Unfortunately, this iteration of Hort also had its fair share of issues. We had neglected to paint on support blockers in the holes for the clips, so most of the holes were full of mostly irremovable support material, so we had to snip off most of the clips. As for the holes that we were able to unblock, the clips snapped off when we tried to disconnect the two sides, leaving us with just two halves of a Hort. While we could have simply glued the two halves together, we really wanted to have a removable design.</p>

We measured the diameter and depth of a magnet, and sized the holes appropriately. Then, we split the two halves of Hort onto two buildplates within the same instance of Prusa (a first for me). This print went even faster than the clip version of Hort, because both sides were able to be laid down on the cut face, reducing the amount of supports and time needed.</p>

                            <p> Finally, we ended up with a perfect version! The magnets press fit perfectly into place, and stayed in even when connecting and disconnecting the two sides. Due to the orientation of the print, the sides all came out especially smooth and good-looking. Additionally, the reduced weight gave Bathilda an easier time driving. Hort successfully allows access to all 5 key features: the wheels can move, the sensors can see the ground, the LEDs are all visible, Hort can be removed easily to change the batteries, and the power button is fully pressable.</p>

                            <p>Next, we moved on to the laser cut version. We started by using the split body feature in Fusion to split the Hort model into several parts, the tail, the back legs/hips, the front legs/hips, and the head/neck. Then we created sketches of the both leg sections by turning the other parts invisible and making projections of each set of legs/hips to capture the outline of them from a front facing view. Then, we extruded those sketches by 3mm to make models of the leg panels. Next, we reassembled the split sections of the original model, and re-split the model to just separate off the legs. </p>

                            <p> After that, we created a sketch projection of the side profile of Hort, and then extruded it by 3mm to get the body piece. Following this, we were able to make all but the extruded projections of Hort invisible, leaving us just with pieces that could be used as a laser cuttable outline. However, we needed a (non-permanent) way for the pieces to actually fit together. So, we cut slots 3mm wide into the pieces that went halfway deep on each of the intersections of the pieces.</p>

                            <p>Personally, I found the e-NABLE hub to be a more useful site to find resources to build the hand. The guides and files were easier and more directly able to be viewed and downloaded, and overall the site seemed more geared specifically towards the hand we were making for this project. However, I like how the NIH website seems to offer more options for other models, and also can show remixes with design tweaks. I think that both sites could better organize how they are laid out, so that there is a clearer step-by-step process shown. For example, I think that if the links on the e-NABLE site were reordered, it could be less contrived to find the correct resources because for me, it was somewhat difficult to navigate to the resources I wanted. Additionally, it might be easier to find if they were somewhat larger or if the videos were embedded on the page, rather than being external links. Personally, I found the videos from the e-NABLE hub to be a little bit more helpful than the instruction manual. I think this is mainly because it was a little confusing in their instructions exactly how many of each part was needed. To remedy this, all that would be needed is an extra page in the instructions saying how many of each part was required. Overall though, the assembly process was pretty straightforward and intuitive for me, so I don’t think anything really needs to change in that department.</p>

                            <p> Printing the hand went pretty smoothly! My partner and I were able to divvy up what we printed to avoid too much redundant printing. I had a minor bit of trouble with one of my prints due to some under extrusion on one printer, but after switching printers we were able to resolve the issue and continue the project. The other issue that I had was in laying out my buildplates. At first I was really set on trying to only use two buildplates; however, I eventually came to the conclusion that there was no way everything would fit on so little space, especially with extra space being taken up by rafts and supports. This was a really good lesson about when to stop being stubborn and be more realistic.</p>

                            <p>Assembly was also really easy to follow. The only minor trouble with assembly was we made a minor mistake when stringing the fingers, in that we forgot to thread it through a set of holes, but that was easily remedied. I also messed up a little bit in a different way, as when I was removing the raft/supports from one of the parts I succeeded a little too well and ended up gouging my hand a bit with the pair of snippers I was using. This was a good learning moment because it was a great reminder to take things a little slower and steadier, and overall be more careful. </p>

                            <p> For our modification, we wanted to add some kind of phone mount to the gauntlet, because we came to the realization that the grip strength on the hand was good, but not fantastic, so holding a phone for hours out of a day seemed a little unfeasible. So, by adding an adjustable phone mount, we figured that we would be able to make a more comfortable way to hold the phone. In our original sketch we thought about a more compact design, but figured that it would be too difficult to operate with only one fully functional hand, as well as that it would be more restricted to a certain phone, due to the specific measurements. So, after some browsing on Thingiverse, we found a model that could be folded compactly, while being overall more adjustable and user-friendly, as well as easier to remove and maneuver for purposes such as charging, making phone calls, etc.</p>

                            <p>Overall, this project was a really interesting challenge. It was certainly one of the projects that we did, so it was rewarding to take on the rapid prototyping mindset in this way. This project also felt different because of what we were making. Instead of just creating something to learn, be creative, and fulfil the project guidelines, I found myself thinking about the actual usefulness of the product. I found myself wondering what it would be like to use a prosthetic like the one we made if I were missing a hand or fingers. This really made me think about the elements of empathetic design that is discussed in Sarah Hendren’s What Can a Body Do? How We Meet the Built World. Particularly, the question of who the world is built for (Hendren 28) is really striking to me. Only by thinking in this way was I able to start to see the issues with the hand for that needed modification. I think that this outlook is a really powerful tool for design equity, and I hope to take it forward with me into the next project.</p>

                <ul>As Americans get older and wealthier, interest in "aging-in-place design" is growing. This approach focuses on making homes accessible for people of all abilities, going beyond basic requirements like the ADA. It reflects broader trends of larger, more luxurious homes, driven by increased wealth. While inclusive design improves accessibility, it comes with trade-offs, as seen in examples like replacing knobs with levers for easier use or changes made for pets, showing that no design suits everyone’s needs.</ul>

                <ul>This study examined the use, awareness, and helpfulness of features that could improve the quality of life for people with arthritis, including features such as lever door handles. However, less than half were aware of such features, and only a small minority had them in their homes. The study suggests that increasing awareness of these features is key to maximizing their potential in improving arthritis treatment and quality of life.</ul>

Due to their wrist injury and residual effects (such as pain), they struggle to open door knobs with their injured hand. The solutions they had found in their daily life have been using their other (non-dominant) hand, and preferring doors with levers or push operation.

To do this, we took a short period of time to write down aspects, words, notes, etc. related to the interviews that particularly stood out to us. From this, we synthesized the general themes of locations, movement restrictions, required materials, extensions, features, installation, and scope, which we took into consideration going forward into the insight statement phase. </p>

                            <p> After spending time discussing the themes we decided on, we came up with a list of seven insight statements that addressed our themes. We quickly followed that step by drafting several “how might we” statements in order to come up with areas of design to focus our brainstorming for. To accomplish each of these steps, we set a short timer and separately wrote our ideas on sticky notes until the timer was up, after which we came back together to discuss our insights. I found these phases of the brainstorming process to be really beneficial. Not only were we able to explore many avenues of thinking, but were able to simultaneously widen and narrow our focus in a really productive and interesting way.</p>

                            <p> We then had a lively and respectful conversation where we discussed our own and each other's ideas, and grouped them together or eliminated them with consensus. After this process, we were left with a much more focused area of work. We ended up with the synthesized idea of creating a 3-D printed attachment that would clamp onto door knobs in order to convert them into lever door handles for both convenience and to facilitate better door usage for people with arm injuries.</p>

                            <p> The design and prototyping process for creating accessible door accessories has primarily been testing existing models found online and interviewing some users in one of our target demographics to understand their likes and dislikes of the existing solutions. 
In our interviews, we received many pieces of feedback, positive and negative, all helping us refine our idea. One of our primary takeaways from these interviews was that users did not want to have something that needs to be put on and taken off every time they want to open the door, however, having something portable would be nice in situations where the door knobs are sticky and the doors are heavy.

                            <p>Another takeaway from this process was that being able to open a door with your elbow is very useful, not just for those with mobility issues, but also if your hands are full, being able to use your elbow to open a door is very useful. From this piece of feedback, we decided to make sure the handle would stick out far enough to ensure a person would be able to put sufficient pulling force on the door to turn the handle and open the door. 
Not all of the feedback was positive though, in one of our interviews, we received the feedback that the handle did not feel secure on the door. This one is particularly important, as the handle needs to be able to secure to all kinds of door knobs while still being easily removable when necessary.

                            <p> Another comment about the stability of the handle was less about the securing method to the door, and more about feeling secure when grabbing the handle to open the door. It was suggested that we add a curve to the end of the handle, making an almost L shape to ensure a hand cannot slide out of the handle while twisting it. This L shape would also provide more stability when opening the door with an elbow, as it would provide a bumper in that situation as well. Overall, the feedback we received was very helpful in furthering our design and our understanding of our problem at hand.

                            <p>From this feedback, we gleaned several main guiding principles. From our understanding, our users want a handle that can be easily operated, even by one’s elbows. Another is that we need to make a design that stays on the door securely, while simultaneously being non-permanent. Additionally, one of our principles going forward is to make a universal design that works on (nearly) any door knob and only uses 3-D printed parts and common hardware. Lastly, we want to make sure to utilize a design that is easy for our team to iterate on throughout the design process.

                            <p>We made some changes to our How Might We statements while collecting and analyzing feedback on our initial prototype. We found that our initial design already fit several different door knob shapes, but a more pressing issue was that it could be easily pulled or pushed out of place, or off of the door knob completely. We also decided that the durability of metal screws outweighed the problem of accessibility of materials, since most students at Brandeis who would possibly be 3D printing this design would already be in a maker space to do so. In this case, we would want to ensure that those spaces were stocked with the additional materials needed to assemble our door knob adapter.

                            <p>This prototype is our first iteration from the pre-existing model we found online. This iteration uses the standard ~55mm diameter opening for the door knob to fit in with a modified 30mm height for the door knob to hold on to. Originally, the amount of space for the plastic to interface with the door knob was less, which resulted in lower rates of success when opening the door. As you can see in the image, the handle does not go flush to the outer ring of the circular section, this proved to be a weak point, allowing for too much flex when using the device.

We also redrew the design in fusion in order to reduce the amount of faces and simplify the model for our own ease of prototyping going forward.
