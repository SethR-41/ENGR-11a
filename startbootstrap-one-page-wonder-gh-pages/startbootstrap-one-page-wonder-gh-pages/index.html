                            <p>This project was fairly simple! I started by downloading the proper 3MF file for the name tag and opening it in Prusa Slicer, which I already had downloaded from my Ancient Technology and Modern Technology class with Professor Ratzlaff last semester. After that, I was able to edit the font and change the name tag so that it actually has my name on it. My print ended up using 4.03 grams of filament and taking a little over 20 minutes, and I printed it with a brown base and switched it to a yellow filament during the filament swap.</p>

                            <p>As for the actual printing process itself, there was really only a minor hiccup in that the printer was unresponsive at first, but by simply power cycling the machine, I was able to get it up and running properly again in no time. The filament swap was also relatively easy, and I didn’t run into any issues regarding improper feeding or anything. I am really pleased with how it came out!</p>

                            <p>To start this part of the project, I looked around on Thingiverse and Printables to find something that seemed like a difficult print (based off of my rather rudimentary knowledge of 3D printing). After looking through several different models, I ended up finding one that seemed nearly impossible. It had large, unsupported overhangs and included several upside down cones with tiny points of contact to the build plate. In fact, I was even recommended to add a two-layer raft so that there was even a slim chance of it printing somewhat correctly. (Which I did add, not that it ended up helping that much.) After downloading the STL and uploading it to Prusa Slicer, I had to scale it down so it would fit on the build plate. I found making that sort of small edit with Prusa to be pretty simple! I can definitely see myself finding some cool models to print in the future (I’m already planning on printing a deck box for Magic the Gathering soon) and those sorts of simple, in-slicer edits will most definitely be helpful.</p>

                            <p>When it comes to the physical print, things most certainly went wrong. Just in watching the first few layers, I could immediately see that the sections based off of small points of contact on the plate were already not sticking well to the rafts. I was honestly surprised when I saw well the bridging sections came out, all things considered. Granted, there was still not amazing bridging, as the underside of those sections were a little bit rough and stringy. Other than that, I mostly ended up with a mess of filament spaghetti, which I think is due to the printer trying to print on top of air because the layers that those sections were supposed to print over did not adhere to the bed. Apparently, the print even had to be stopped part way through because it was beginning to form a gloopy slug. Overall, this project was very helpful for me to get an idea of the limits and capabilities of this kind of 3D printing, and I think I will have a better understanding of what these machines are capable of, not to mention that I should definitely use supports when the slicer advises me to!</p>
